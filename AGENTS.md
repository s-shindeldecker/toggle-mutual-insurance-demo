# AGENTS.md — Working Agreement

This document is the source of truth for any contributor (human or AI agent)
working in this repository. Read it before making changes.

## Project

Toggle Mutual Insurance — a demo app that runs a quote decision flow with
safe backend experimentation via LaunchDarkly feature flags.

## Stack constraints

- **Runtime:** Node.js (CommonJS — `"type": "commonjs"` in package.json)
- **Frontend:** React 18 via ESM CDN (`esm.sh`) + `htm` tagged templates. No JSX.
- **Server:** Plain `http.createServer`. Express is a dependency but is **not used**.
- **Styling:** Inline `<style>` in `src/ui/index.html`. No CSS framework.
- **Build tooling:** None. No bundler, no transpiler, no TypeScript.
- **Tests:** No test framework. Verification uses `scripts/smoke.js` (plain Node).

Do **not** introduce TypeScript, a bundler, or a test framework unless explicitly
asked. Keep all source files as CommonJS `.js`.

## Architecture rules

1. **"The browser may react; the server must decide."**
   Decision flags (eligibility, pricing, risk, strategy) are evaluated
   server-side only. Client-side flags are presentation-only (copy, layout).

2. **Flag keys are owned by exactly one side.** Server flags drive decisions
   (eligibility, pricing, risk, strategy). Client flags drive presentation
   (copy, layout, labels). The UI reflects server decisions only via derived
   fields in the API response — never by evaluating a decision flag itself.

3. The quote decision pipeline lives in `src/quote/decisionFlow.js`.
   Steps run sequentially: init → models → eligibility → guardrails →
   strategy → offer → complete. Do not reorder or skip steps. New steps
   must be **appended** (never inserted) and documented in this file and
   in `docs/analytics-events.md` if they emit events.

4. Analytics events follow the taxonomy in `docs/analytics-events.md`.
   Event names are `<domain>_<action>`, lower-case snake_case. Payloads
   are additive-only; breaking changes require a new event name.

5. Model outputs (`modelOutputs`) are **never** sent to the client.
   The server strips them before responding.

6. **Smoke test coverage is mandatory.** Any change to an endpoint, route,
   or user-visible behavior must add or update assertions in
   `scripts/smoke.js`. `npm run verify` must pass before committing.

7. **Offline-first for LaunchDarkly.** The app must function fully when
   `LD_ENABLED=false` or when SDK keys are missing. Every flag evaluation
   must supply a sensible default so the baseline flow works without
   network access.

8. **Safe dependency removal.** Before removing a dependency: (a) prove it
   is unused by searching all source files, (b) remove the import/require,
   (c) run `npm run verify` and confirm it passes. Do not remove and
   verify in separate steps.

## LaunchDarkly conventions

### Server-side flags (src/experiments/launchdarklyClient.js)

| Flag key                           | Type    | Default      |
|------------------------------------|---------|-------------|
| `coverage-recommendation-strategy` | string  | `"baseline"` |
| `instant-quote-enabled`            | boolean | `true`       |
| `pricing-engine-enabled`           | boolean | `true`       |
| `risk-model-variant`               | string  | `"baseline"` |
| `pricing-model-variant`            | string  | `"baseline"` |
| `shadow-risk-scoring-enabled`      | boolean | `false`      |
| `shadow-pricing-scoring-enabled`   | boolean | `false`      |

### Client-side flags (src/ui/app.js)

| Flag key                  | Type   | Default                         |
|---------------------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| `mascot-text-box`         | string | `"Meet ToMu — the Tree Shrew"` |
| `about-us-button-color`   | string | `"#2b6cb0"`                     |
| `about-hero-image`        | string | `"none"`                        |
| `about-team-image`        | string | `"none"`                        |
| `about-platform-image`    | string | `"none"`                        |
| `about-mascot-image`      | string | `"none"`                        |

### Multi-context

Both server and client build `kind: "multi"` contexts with sub-contexts:
`session`, `user`, `vehicle`, `location`. Client and server contexts are
built independently from the same form data.

### MCP tooling

The LaunchDarkly MCP server (`user-LaunchDarkly`) is available in Cursor
for flag management (list, get, create, update, delete flags and AI configs).

## Shadow scoring (diagnostic)

Shadow scoring is controlled by `shadow-risk-scoring-enabled` and
`shadow-pricing-scoring-enabled` (server-side boolean flags, default `false`,
typically configured as percentage rollouts in LaunchDarkly).

- Shadow scoring is **diagnostic only** — it never affects eligibility, offer
  construction, or lifecycle events.
- Shadow pricing uses the **assigned** risk score as input (decoupled) to
  support per-model drift monitoring. There is no coupled mode.
- Results appear in `decisionSummary.shadowResults` (sanitized, no PII, no
  `modelOutputs`).

## Environment variables

See `.env.example` for the full list. Required variables for LaunchDarkly
integration:

| Variable                 | Purpose                          |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `PORT`                   | Server listen port (default 3000)|
| `LAUNCHDARKLY_SDK_KEY`   | Server-side flag evaluation      |
| `LAUNCHDARKLY_CLIENT_ID` | Client-side flag evaluation      |

The app runs without LD keys — all flags fall back to defaults.

## Scripts

| Command           | What it does                                    |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `npm run dev`     | Start the dev server (`node src/ui/server.js`)  |
| `npm run verify`  | Require-check all modules + run smoke tests     |

Always run `npm run verify` before committing.

## Code style

- No test frameworks. Verification lives in `scripts/`.
- Comments explain non-obvious intent, not what the code does.
- Analytics failures must not interrupt the quote lifecycle.
- All new server-side flags need a fallback default value.
- Keep fake models deterministic (no `Math.random`).
